Phoenix Club Web Portal — Full-Stack Web Application
Tech Stack: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla), LocalStorage


            Project Overview
            
A zero-backend, fully responsive club management portal built using only client-side technologies. Supports three distinct user roles (Admin, Member, and Public) with role-based access control and dynamic content rendering.

            Key Features

• Built a fully functional club management portal using vanilla JavaScript, comprising 3 main user flows (Admin, Member, and Public) and 10+ pages, streamlining operations and user interactions.
• Designed & implemented an admin dashboard supporting event creation, user management, subscription toggling, and real-time attendance tracking, with 100% local session control via LocalStorage.
• Developed a members-only dashboard with login authentication, premium content access, and event registration, enhancing UX through fully client-side logic.
• Integrated an admin-only announcement system, dynamically visible to all users, enhancing real-time communication across sessions.
• Implemented role-based access control and client-side routing protection for admin users to ensure secure access and redirection.
• Deployed public-facing informational pages (e.g., courses.html, airrifle.html, gallery.html) with responsive design, achieving 100% mobile compatibility.
• Used browser LocalStorage as a lightweight DB substitute, enabling persistent state management for events, announcements, and subscriptions.
• Achieved a zero-dependency, zero-backend architecture for quick deployment and demo readiness without requiring any server setup.
